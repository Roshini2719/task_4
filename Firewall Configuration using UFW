Cyber Security Internship - Task 4: Firewall Configuration using UFW on Kali Linux
Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules on Kali Linux using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to block and allow specific network traffic.

Tools Used
Kali Linux

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

Telnet (for testing blocked port)

Terminal

Step-by-Step Instructions and Commands
Check UFW status


sudo ufw status
If UFW is inactive, enable it:


sudo ufw enable
List existing firewall rules


sudo ufw status numbered
Block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)

sudo ufw deny 23
Verify that the rule was added


sudo ufw status numbered
Install Telnet and test connection to port 23

sudo apt install telnet
telnet localhost 23
You should see Connection refused, confirming the port is blocked.

Allow SSH traffic on port 22

sudo ufw allow 22
Remove the Telnet block rule

First, find the rule number blocking port 23:


sudo ufw status numbered
Delete the rule by its number (replace <rule_number> with the actual number):


sudo ufw delete <rule_number>
Final firewall status check


sudo ufw status
